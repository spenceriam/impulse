Writes a file to the local filesystem.

Usage:
- This tool will overwrite an existing file if there is one at the provided path
- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it

Parameters:
- filePath (required): The absolute path to the file to write (must be absolute, not relative)
- content (required): The content to write to the file

Notes:
- Creates parent directories if they don't exist
- Preserves file permissions when overwriting
