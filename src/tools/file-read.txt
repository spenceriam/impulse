Reads a file from the local filesystem.

Usage:
- The filePath parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files)
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned with line numbers starting at 1

Parameters:
- filePath (required): The absolute path to the file to read
- offset (optional): The line number to start reading from (0-based)
- limit (optional): The number of lines to read (defaults to 2000)

Notes:
- You can read multiple files in parallel by making multiple tool calls
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents, you will receive a warning
- You can read image files using this tool
