Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session.

Usage:
- All commands run in the project working directory by default
- Use the workdir parameter to run in a different directory
- AVOID using "cd <directory> && <command>" patterns - use workdir instead

Parameters:
- command (required): The command to execute
- description (required): A clear, concise description of what this command does (5-10 words)
- workdir (optional): The working directory to run the command in
- timeout (optional): Timeout in milliseconds (default 120000 = 2 minutes)

Important Notes:
- Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes
- Output exceeding 2000 lines will be truncated
- Avoid using bash for file operations - use dedicated tools instead:
  - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)
  - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)
  - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)
  - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)
  - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo)

Git Safety:
- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive git commands (push --force, hard reset) without explicit user request
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify) unless explicitly requested
- NEVER commit changes unless explicitly asked
