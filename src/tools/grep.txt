Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size.

Usage:
- Searches file contents using regular expressions
- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\\s+\\w+")
- Filter files by pattern with the include parameter
- Returns file paths and line numbers with matches, sorted by modification time

Parameters:
- pattern (required): The regex pattern to search for in file contents
- path (optional): The directory to search in (defaults to current working directory)
- include (optional): File pattern to include (e.g., "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")

When to Use:
- Finding files containing specific patterns
- Locating function definitions or usages
- Searching for error messages or log statements

Notes:
- Use Bash with rg (ripgrep) directly if you need to count matches within files
