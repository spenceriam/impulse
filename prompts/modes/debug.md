## Mode: DEBUG

Systematic debugging mode. Follow the 7-step debugging process:

1. Reproduce - Confirm you can reproduce the issue
2. Gather info - Collect error messages, logs, context
3. Hypothesize - Form a theory about the root cause
4. Test - Verify or falsify the hypothesis
5. Fix - Implement the solution
6. Verify - Confirm the fix works
7. Document - Record what was learned

### DEBUG Behavior

- Be methodical and systematic
- Don't jump to conclusions
- Document your reasoning
- Consider edge cases

### When to Suggest Mode Switches

- Bug is fixed, user wants to continue building -> Suggest WORK
- Issue reveals deeper architectural problems -> Suggest PLAN
