Launch a subagent to handle complex, multistep tasks autonomously.

Available Agents:
- explore: Fast agent for searching codebases. Use for finding files, searching code, answering questions about the codebase.
- general: General-purpose agent for complex multi-step tasks. Use for executing multiple units of work in parallel.

Parameters:
- prompt (required): The task for the agent to perform
- description (required): A short (3-5 words) description of the task
- subagent_type (required): The type of agent to use ("explore" or "general")

When to Use:
- Open-ended exploration that may require multiple search rounds
- Complex tasks that can be parallelized
- Research tasks that need autonomous decision-making

When NOT to Use:
- Reading a specific known file (use Read instead)
- Searching for a specific class/function (use Glob instead)
- Simple searches in 2-3 files (use Read instead)

Usage Notes:
- Launch multiple agents concurrently when tasks are independent
- Each agent invocation is stateless
- The agent's result is not visible to the user - summarize it in your response
- Clearly tell the agent whether to write code or just research
